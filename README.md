## Features

### Date
The date at the top of the scheduler is automatically updated to help the user know what the current date is. 

### Color coded time blocks
The daily scheduler is set up to visually assit the user in assigning colors to the time blocks.
A grey time block indicates that hour has passed, while red represents the current hours, and green represents future hours of the day.

## Blank scheduler at start of day
Local storage is set to clear at midnight, meaning that on a new day and window refresh the user will see a blank scheduler.


## Functionality

Users types thier tasks directly on the time block of thier choice and clicks save to store their item on local storage, which also keeps the task printed on screen.
